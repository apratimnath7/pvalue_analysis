# Test Observation Analysis

A Python package for performing P Value and P-Adjusted Value analysis across multiple statistical tests. This tool is designed to help researchers and data scientists efficiently compute, adjust, and interpret p-values when running multiple hypothesis tests, reducing the risk of false positives.

## Features

- Calculate p-values for multiple tests
- Adjust p-values using common correction methods (e.g., Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg)
- Support for various statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, etc.)
- Easy-to-use command-line interface and Python API
- Output results in CSV or JSON format
